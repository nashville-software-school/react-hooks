# useDeferredValue

`useDeferredValue` is a React hook that lets you defer updating a part of the UI.

## Purpose and Explanation

The main purpose of `useDeferredValue` is to improve the perceived performance of your application by allowing non-critical parts of the UI to update at a lower priority.

## Typical Usage

```javascript
import React, { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';

function MyComponent({ data }) {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const deferredText = useDeferredValue(text);

  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <SlowList data={data} text={deferredText} />
    </>
  );
}

function SlowList({ data, text }) {
  const filteredData = data.filter(item => item.includes(text));
  return (
    <ul>
      {filteredData.map(item => (
        <li key={item}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

In this example, `deferredText` will lag behind the actual `text` state, allowing the input to remain responsive while the `SlowList` updates at a lower priority.

## When to Use

*   **Improving Perceived Performance:** Use `useDeferredValue` when you have a part of the UI that is slow to update and doesn't need to be updated immediately.
*   **Keeping the UI Responsive:** `useDeferredValue` can help keep the UI responsive by allowing non-critical updates to be deferred.

To sum it up, `useDeferredValue` is a valuable tool for improving the perceived performance of your application by deferring updates to non-critical parts of the UI.
