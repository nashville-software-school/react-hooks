# useDeferredValue

`useDeferredValue` is a React hook that lets you defer updating a part of the UI. It allows you to keep your application responsive by deferring less critical updates, ensuring a smoother user experience.

## Purpose and Explanation

The main purpose of `useDeferredValue` is to improve the perceived performance of your application by allowing non-critical parts of the UI to update at a lower priority. This is particularly useful when you have a slow or computationally expensive component that can cause the UI to lag or freeze. By deferring the update of this component, you can keep the rest of the UI responsive and provide a better user experience.

`useDeferredValue` is especially helpful when dealing with large datasets, complex calculations, or slow network requests. It allows you to prioritize the rendering of essential UI elements while deferring the update of less critical components until the browser has time to process them.

## How to Use It

The `useDeferredValue` hook takes one argument:

1.  **value:** The value you want to defer. This can be any React state or prop that you want to update at a lower priority.

**Return Value:**

`useDeferredValue` returns a deferred version of the value you passed in. This deferred value will initially be the same as the original value, but it may lag behind if the UI is busy.

**Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useDeferredValue, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(()=> {
    const newData = [];
    for(let i=0; i<50000; i++){
      newData.push(i+"");
    }
    return newData;
  });
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const [listItems, setListItems] = useState([]);
  const deferredText = useDeferredValue(text);

  useEffect( ()=> {
    console.log("render:"+text+","+deferredText);
    const newListItems = data.map(item => {
      if (item.includes(deferredText)) return item+" < --- ";
      else return item;
    });
    setListItems(newListItems);
  },[deferredText, data]);
  
  
  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <ul>
        {listItems.map(item => (
          <li key={item}>{item}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

In this example, `deferredText` will lag behind the actual `text` state, allowing the input to remain responsive while the `slowList` updates at a lower priority. If you type in a series of characters very quickly, it will not console.log for each character. If you replace `deferredText` in the useEffect dependency array with `text`, then you'll see it log on every change. This demonstrates how useDeferredValue intelligently batches quick changes like this, which prevents unnecessary renders and improves responsiveness. 

Note that this functionality and simulating the performance lag can cause different behavior on different machines. You might get lagging or timeout errors. Alternately, you might find it hard to type fast enough to outpace your computer.

## When to Use

*   **Improving Perceived Performance:** Use `useDeferredValue` when you have a part of the UI that is slow to update and doesn't need to be updated immediately.
*   **Keeping the UI Responsive:** `useDeferredValue` can help keep the UI responsive by allowing non-critical updates to be deferred.
*   **Large Datasets:** Use `useDeferredValue` when rendering large datasets that can cause the UI to lag.
*   **Complex Calculations:** Use `useDeferredValue` when performing complex calculations that can block the main thread.
*   **Slow Network Requests:** Use `useDeferredValue` when fetching data from a slow network request.

To sum it up, `useDeferredValue` is a valuable tool for improving the perceived performance of your application by deferring updates to non-critical parts of the UI. It helps keep the UI responsive and provides a smoother user experience, especially when dealing with slow or computationally expensive components.
