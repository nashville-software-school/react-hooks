# useLayoutEffect

`useLayoutEffect` is a React hook that is similar to `useEffect`, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations.

## Purpose and Explanation

The main purpose of `useLayoutEffect` is to read layout from the DOM and synchronously re-render. This is useful to avoid screen flickering or other visual inconsistencies.

## Typical Usage

```javascript
import React, { useState, useLayoutEffect, useRef } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [height, setHeight] = useState(0);
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    // Measure the height of the element
    setHeight(ref.current.offsetHeight);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div ref={ref}>
      My Content
      <p>Height: {height}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `useLayoutEffect` is used to measure the height of the element after it has been rendered to the DOM. This ensures that the height is measured correctly, even if the element's content changes.

## When to Use

*   **Measuring DOM Elements:** Use `useLayoutEffect` when you need to measure the size or position of a DOM element.
*   **Synchronous Re-rendering:** `useLayoutEffect` can be used to synchronously re-render a component after the DOM has been updated.

To sum it up, `useLayoutEffect` is a valuable tool for reading layout from the DOM and synchronously re-rendering, avoiding screen flickering or other visual inconsistencies.
