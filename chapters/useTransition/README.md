# useTransition

`useTransition` is a React hook that lets you update the state without blocking the UI.

## Purpose and Explanation

The main purpose of `useTransition` is to keep the UI responsive while performing a potentially slow state update.

## Typical Usage

```javascript
import React, { useState, useTransition } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    const value = e.target.value;
    setText(value);
    startTransition(() => {
      // Simulate a slow data filtering
      const filteredData = someExpensiveFilteringFunction(value);
      setData(filteredData);
    });
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={handleChange} />
      {isPending ? 'Loading...' : <MyList data={data} />}
    </>
  );
}
```

In this example, `useTransition` is used to update the `data` state without blocking the UI. The `isPending` flag indicates whether the transition is in progress.

## When to Use

*   **Slow State Updates:** Use `useTransition` when you have a state update that is slow and could block the UI.
*   **Keeping the UI Responsive:** `useTransition` can help keep the UI responsive by allowing state updates to be performed in the background.

To sum it up, `useTransition` is a valuable tool for updating the state without blocking the UI, keeping the application responsive during slow state updates.
