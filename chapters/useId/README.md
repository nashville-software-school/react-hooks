# useId

`useId` is a React hook that lets you generate unique IDs that are stable across the client and server. These IDs are useful for accessibility and avoiding conflicts when rendering components in different environments.

## Purpose and Explanation

The main purpose of `useId` is to avoid ID clashes when rendering components on the server and then hydrating them on the client. When building React applications with server-side rendering, it's crucial to ensure that the IDs generated on the server match the IDs generated on the client. Otherwise, React may throw hydration errors, leading to unexpected behavior.

`useId` solves this problem by generating unique IDs that are guaranteed to be the same on both the client and the server. This ensures that your components are properly hydrated and that your application behaves consistently across different environments.

## How to Use It

The `useId` hook takes no arguments.

**Return Value:**

`useId` returns a unique ID that is stable across the client and server. The ID is a string that starts with the `:` character.

**Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useId } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const id = useId();
  const inputId = `my-input${id}`;

  return (
    <>
      <label htmlFor={inputId}>My Input</label>
      <input id={inputId} type="text" />
    </>
  );
}
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

In this example, `useId` is used to generate a unique ID for the input element. The ID is then used to create a unique `inputId` that is used as the `htmlFor` attribute of the label and the `id` attribute of the input element. This ensures that the label and input are properly associated, improving accessibility.

## When to Use

*   **Generating Unique IDs:** Use `useId` when you need to generate unique IDs for elements in your component, especially when building applications with server-side rendering.
*   **Avoiding ID Clashes:** Use `useId` to avoid ID clashes when rendering components on the server and then hydrating them on the client.
*   **Accessibility:** Use `useId` to generate unique IDs for labels and inputs, ensuring that they are properly associated for accessibility.
*   **Server-Side Rendering:** Use `useId` to ensure that IDs are consistent across the client and server, preventing hydration errors.

To sum it up, `useId` is a valuable tool for generating unique IDs that are stable across the client and server, avoiding ID clashes during hydration, and improving accessibility. It's particularly useful when building React applications with server-side rendering.
